# As of 2.0, MistyClosure contains a reference to its IR. This is because `IRCode` is
# a surprisingly bulky type (136B in 1.11.1 -- the same as 17 Float64s). Since especially
# fast access to `ir` is never needed, it is fine to store it out-of-place, thus reducing
# the size of a `MistyClosure` from 176B to 48B. This can have a substantial impact on the
# performance of calling many `OpaqueClosure`s of the same type.
