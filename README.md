Marginally less opaque closures.

Specifically, a `MistyClosure` is comprises an `OpaqueClosure` and an `IRCode`.
This is useful if you generate an `OpaqueClosure` from an `IRCode`, and want to be able to retrieve the `IRCode` later on.

## Recommended Use

```julia
# Get the `IRCode` associated to `sin(5.0)`.
ir = Base.code_ircode_by_type(Tuple{typeof(sin), Float64})[1][1]

# Produce a `MistyClosure` using it. All kwargs are passed to the `OpaqueClosure`
# constructor.
mc = MistyClosure(ir; do_compile=true)

# Call it.
mc(5.0) == sin(5.0)
```

## Alterative Use

Sometimes you'll already have an `OpaqueClosure` lying around, and not want to produce a new one from an `IRCode` (as this often takes a surprisingly large amount of time).
If ths is the case, you can simply use the default constructor for `MistyClosure`.
That is, write
```julia
mc = MistyClosure(existing_opaque_closure, ir)
```
Of course, it is _your_ responsibility so ensure that `ir` and `existing_opaque_closure` are in agreement.
